Welcome to MetaSenex, a newsletter of resources and reflections guiding more productive retirement years.

This is a website for everyone who has outgrown the routine and expectations of paid employment. It's at this
lifestage that people need ancouragement and raised sights. Here are some ways that people at this stage are
truly gifted with unique strengths.

Older people have years of exploring and developing many competencies. They know what works and just as importantly, what
doesn't.

Older people have extensive personal networks, a depth of social contacts gained through dedication to their work.

Older people have time to striike out in new directions, to apply their new freedom to long-deferred projects.

Older people are often unemcumbered by the family responsibilities of children, education and maintaining a
household.

And finally, older people have financial resources that are the result of a lifetime of working.
