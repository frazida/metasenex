Welcome to MetaSenex, a newsletter of resources and reflections guiding more productive retirement years.

This is a website for everyone who has outgrown the routine and expectations of paid employment. It's at this
lifestage that people need encouragement and raised sights. Here are some ways that people at this stage are
gifted with unique strengths.

Older people have years of exploring and developing many competencies. They know what works and just as importantly, what
doesn't.

Older people have extensive personal networks, a depth of social contacts gained through dedication to their work.

Older people have time to strike out in new directions, to apply their new freedom to long-deferred projects.

Older people are often unencumbered by the family responsibilities of children, education and maintaining a
household.

And finally, older people have financial resources that are the result of a lifetime of working.

This newsletter will be your window on a new world of challenge and possibilities.
